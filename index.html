    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 2025</p>

    <p>
      Heart of Deeds ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the personal data of all users of the Heart of Deeds mobile application ("the App"). 
      This Privacy Policy outlines how information may be collected, used, and safeguarded when you use our App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Heart of Deeds is designed to promote spiritual reflection and self-accountability. 
      The App operates locally on your device and does not require you to create an account or submit personal information directly. 
      However, like most applications, limited information may be collected automatically to ensure functionality and performance, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type and operating system (for compatibility purposes)</li>
      <li>Anonymous usage statistics (to help improve the app experience)</li>
      <li>Error or crash logs (to fix bugs and improve stability)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email, or contact details through the App.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      Any data that may be collected automatically is used solely for the purposes of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improving app functionality and performance</li>
      <li>Ensuring compatibility across devices</li>
      <li>Fixing technical issues or errors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not sell, trade, or rent user data to any third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may include integrations or libraries from trusted third-party providers, such as Google Play Services or analytics tools. 
      These services may collect limited technical data as governed by their respective privacy policies. 
      Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of these third-party services for more information.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement reasonable administrative and technical measures to safeguard user information. 
      While no system is completely secure, we strive to ensure that all data handled by the App remains private and protected in accordance with applicable privacy standards.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children‚Äôs Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Heart of Deeds does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13. 
      If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately so that we can delete such data.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect improvements, regulatory changes, or other operational needs.
