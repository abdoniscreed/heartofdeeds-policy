  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Heart of Deeds</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is fully committed to protecting all user data. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, stored, and safeguarded when you use the Heart of Deeds mobile application ("the App").</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App is designed for personal reflection and spiritual self-accountability. It functions entirely <strong>offline</strong> and does <strong>not</strong> require registration, login, or any personal data submission.</p>

  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or location.</p>
  <p>However, limited non-personal technical information may be collected automatically, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device model and Android version (for compatibility)</li>
    <li>Anonymous usage data related to app performance</li>
    <li>Basic crash or error logs (to improve stability)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>Any automatically collected information is used solely to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Improve app stability, responsiveness, and performance</li>
    <li>Identify and fix bugs or technical issues</li>
    <li>Ensure proper display and compatibility across devices</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, trade, rent, or share user data with any third party. No behavioral tracking, targeted advertising, or profiling occurs within the App.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Heart of Deeds may utilize certain trusted system-level libraries for app stability and performance, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong> (required by Android apps)</li>
    <li><strong>AndroidX libraries</strong> (for app stability)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services may handle minimal device-related data governed by their own privacy policies. Heart of Deeds does <strong>not</strong> include or integrate any social media, advertising, or analytics SDKs that track user behavior.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Protecting user privacy is central to the Heart of Deeds design. We have implemented strong technical and administrative safeguards to ensure all user data remains private and secure, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local-Only Data Storage</strong> – All user actions (good deeds, sins, streaks, and notes) are stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device only.</li>
    <li><strong>End-to-End Encryption</strong> – All app data is secured using <strong>AES-256 encryption</strong> via Android’s EncryptedSharedPreferences technology.</li>
    <li><strong>Code & Network Protection</strong> – The app’s code is <strong>obfuscated and optimized</strong> using Android’s ProGuard and resource-shrinking tools to prevent reverse engineering.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Security Configuration</strong> – Blocks all unencrypted (HTTP) traffic to prevent accidental data leaks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. User-Controlled Data</h2>
  <p>All data is fully managed on your device. You may clear the app’s data or uninstall it at any time to delete all stored information instantly.</p>
  <p>While no system can be guaranteed to be completely secure, we continuously strive to maintain and exceed best-practice security standards in line with Android and Google Play policies.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Heart of Deeds does not knowingly collect or store personal information from children under 13. Because no personal data is required or collected, the App is inherently safe for all age groups.</p>
  <p>If you believe a child has provided personal data through external means, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect technical improvements, security enhancements, or regulatory requirements. Any updates will be reflected on this page, and the <strong>Effective Date</strong> above will be updated accordingly.</p>
  <p>By using the App, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy. Continued use of the App after such changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us:</p>
