# Privacy Policy
**Effective Date:** October 2025

Heart of Deeds ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is fully committed to protecting all user data.  
This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, stored, and safeguarded when you use the Heart of Deeds mobile application ("the App").

---

## 1. Information We Collect

Heart of Deeds is intentionally designed for personal reflection and spiritual self-accountability.  
The App functions entirely **offline** and does **not** require registration, login, or personal data submission.

We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or location.

However, the App may process limited non-personal technical information automatically, such as:

- Device model and Android version (for compatibility)
- Anonymous usage data related to app performance
- Basic crash or error logs (to improve stability)

These details are handled locally on your device and are **not linked** to your identity.

---

## 2. How We Use Information

Any automatically collected information is used solely to:

- Improve app stability, responsiveness, and performance  
- Identify and fix bugs or technical issues  
- Ensure proper display and compatibility across different devices  

We do **not** sell, trade, rent, or share user data with any third party.  
No behavioral tracking, targeted advertising, or profiling occurs within the App.

---

## 3. Third-Party Services

Heart of Deeds may utilize certain trusted system-level libraries or frameworks, such as:

- **Google Play Services** (required by all Android apps)  
- **AndroidX libraries** for app stability and performance  

These services may handle minimal device-related data as governed by their own policies.  
Users are encouraged to review Google’s Privacy Policy for more information.  

Heart of Deeds does **not** include or integrate any social media, advertising, or analytics SDKs that track user behavior.

---

## 4. Data Security

Protecting user privacy is central to the Heart of Deeds design.  
We have implemented **strong technical and administrative safeguards** to ensure that all user data remains private and secure, including:

### Local-Only Data Storage
- All user actions (good deeds, sins, streaks, and notes) are stored **locally** on your device only.  
- No data is uploaded, transmitted, or shared with any external server.

### End-to-End Encryption
- All local app data is secured using **AES-256 encryption** via **Android’s EncryptedSharedPreferences** technology.  
- This ensures all stored information remains unreadable to any other apps or unauthorized access, even if the device is compromised.

### Code and Network Protection
- The app’s code is **obfuscated and optimized** using Android’s ProGuard and resource-shrinking tools to prevent reverse engineering.  
- A **Network Security Configuration** is enforced to block all unencrypted (HTTP) network traffic, preventing accidental data leaks.  
- The app does not request unnecessary permissions and cannot access external data sources.

### User-Controlled Data
- All data is fully managed on your device.  
- You may clear the app’s data or uninstall the App at any time to delete all stored information instantly.

While no system can be guaranteed to be completely secure, we continuously strive to maintain and exceed best-practice security standards in line with Android and Google Play policies.

## 5. Children’s Privacy

Heart of Deeds does not knowingly collect or store personal information from children under the age of 13.  
Because no personal data is required or collected, the App is inherently safe for all age groups.

If you believe that a child has provided any personal data through external means, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

---

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect technical improvements, security enhancements, or regulatory requirements.  
Any updates will be reflected on this page, and the **“Effective Date”** above will be updated accordingly.  
Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
